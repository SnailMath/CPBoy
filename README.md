# CPBoyHHK

This CPBoyHHK is a fork of the [CPBoy gameboy emulator by diddyholz](https://github.com/diddyholz/CPBoy) for the fc-cp400 aka Classpad II. My goal with CPBoyHK is to make it compatible with [hollyhock-2](https://github.com/SnailMath/hollyhock-2). I forked CPBoy because the required sdk and launcher are not fully publick, so I wanted to port this to hollyhock-2, which is completely open and available for everyone to install: Watch the [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/Llibqwt7Jsg) about the installation process of hollyhock-2, or the [installation tutorial](https://youtu.be/Bg_wUcWb6KQ).

CPBoy is a work in progress DMG GameBoy emulator for the fx-CP400. It based on the [Peanut-GB emulator by deltabeard](https://github.com/deltabeard/Peanut-GB).

Since the CAS has a rather slow processor, a high speed emulator core is mandatory to run emulation at an acceptable speed. Unfortunately, the accuracy of the emulation suffers a bit, which causes some games to be unplayable or have bugs. 


## Getting Started

This fork is not finished yet... When it is, you can just put the .bin or the .hhk file from the releases tab onto your calculator, where [hollyhock-2 is already installed](https://github.com/SnailMath/hollyhock-2/releases). And then just select the GB emulator from the hollyhock-2 launcher menu... But I haven't completed the port, so it is not possible... yet...

<s>
The SDK used by the emulator and the CFW necessary to run it, is not public at the moment. Therefore it is currently not possible for you to use this emulator.

As soon as the SDK and custom firmware have reached a usable state, I will make them public and update this section with an installation tutorial.
